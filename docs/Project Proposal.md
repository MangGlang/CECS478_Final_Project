Final Project Proposal - OSI Encapsulation Explorer

Name: Hoa Nguyen, Minhlee Lam
Repo: https://github.com/MangGlang/CECS478_Final_Project
Problem Statement
Understanding how data travels through the layers of the OSI model is one of the foundational concepts. This process is often overlooked as students and analysts see the outcome of the packets on a network and not the layered transformations that occur along the way. The goal of this project is to create an interactive system that visually demonstrates how network packets are encapsulated and decapsulated as they pass through the OSI layers. The system will parse network data, show each encapsulation step, and optionally export these steps into a JSON or CSV format for further analysis. By building this tool, we aim to provide a clear and reproducible educational demonstration of OSI-layer encapsulation using real or simulated traffic.

Threat Model
Assets:
Packet data: The PCAP files or live captures (synthetic) used for demonstration.
Visualization outputs: The exported CSV or JSON files that summarize encapsulation steps.
System integrity: The accuracy and reliability of the parsing logic and visualization modules.
Execution environment: The Docker-based sandbox used to run the project and prevent unauthorized network access.
Threat Actors:
Input validation gaps: If the parser accepts arbitrary PCAP files, malformed inputs could cause exceptions or crashes.
File I/O operations: Reading and writing artifacts (e.g., packet captures, exported summaries) without validation could risk overwriting or accessing unintended files.
Visualization endpoints: If the visualization component evolves into a lightweight web interface, it might introduce exposure via local ports or HTTP endpoints.
Assumptions:
All data is synthetic, anonymized, or generated locally for demonstration purposes.
The tool will not be connected to any production or campus network.
Execution will take place inside a Docker container, isolated from the host machine.
Planned Defenses:
Environment isolation: All components will run within Docker containers using non-root users and limited filesystem permissions.
Error handling: Implement safe parsing routines to prevent crashes on malformed inputs.
Strict input validation: Only allow reading .pcap or .pcapng files from the local directory
Logging and transparency: The tool will maintain logs of all parsed files and exports to ensure traceability.
Success Metrics
We will measure the projects success based on the following criterias:
Successfully parses and visualizes at least five layers of the OSI model from a packet capture (PCAP).
Demonstrates correct encapsulation and decapsulation order for sample traffic
Generates exportable summaries (CSV or JSON) showing layer-by-layer information for at least three example packets.
Dataset/Pcap Plan
We will use synthetic packet captures generated through controlled local traffic, such as simple HTTP requests or ping commands, using tools 
scapy (Python packet crafting)
tcpdump or Wireshark for small offline captures
The datasets will be small to keep the analysis simple and reproducible. Each capture will demonstrate specific OSI layer combinations:
ICMP echo requests (Layer 3–4 focus)
HTTP GET requests (Layer 7 focus)
DNS lookups (showing UDP encapsulation)
Risks and Ethics
There will be minimal risk for this project since there is no live or third party network monitoring involved. We will only use synthetic or anonymized traffic to analyze. The purpose is solely educational and fully compliant with responsible data handling principles. We will rescript captures to local docker networks only to avoid unintentionally sniffing real traffic. Ensure all demonstration datasets are generated by the team, using only approved lab environments. Network inspection can be performed responsibly, transparently, and with clear consent.
System Architecture
The OSI encapsulation Explorer will follow a modular design with three components:
Packet Input Module – Imports or generates PCAPs (via scapy or tcpdump). Responsible for basic validation and safe handling of all input files.
Encapsulation Parser – Extracts headers and reconstructs OSI layers using Python libraries such as dpkt or pyshark. This component will map protocols to OSI layers (e.g., IP = Layer 3, TCP = Layer 4) and provide structured data for visualization.
Visualization & Exporter – Displays results in a simple terminal interface and exports summaries to CSV and JSON formats.
